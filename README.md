## Features
* 2-player game with 4x3 gameboard
* 4 different colors to choose from

## How to play
* 2 players play in turn
* first pick a desired color(red, green, blue or yellow)
* select field on gameboard
* picked field will change into selected color
* same time computer will change randomly 3 colors fields on gameboard
* goal is to get 3 or 4 same field in one line(horizontally, vertically or diagonally)
* 3 in a row will give 3 points
* 4 in a row will give 5 points if you add your color to each end[X000 or 000X]
* 4 in a row will give 8 points if you add your color in the middle[0X00 or 0X00]
* whoever gets 100 points first is the winner
